# Airport-Simulation

This application implements the simulation of Airport
The program is to simulate the operation of one day's activity at an airport,and output the times waiting to land and take off for each BWIA flight.
The program also performs a random simulation of the airport, showing the status of the runway at each time interval
This program simulates an airport with only one runway.One plane can land or depart in each unit of time.

Here you can Reserve your Flight tickets that are currenlty on Airport
 
Input:  The user must supply the number of time intervals the simulation is to
      run, the expected number of flights arriving, the expected number
      of flights departing per time interval, and the
      maximum allowed size for runway queues.
      
Output : The program performs a random simulation of the airport, showing
      the status of the runway at each time interval, and prints out a
      summary of airport operation at the conclusion.
      
Uses: Classes Runway, Plane, Random and functions run_idle, initialize.
